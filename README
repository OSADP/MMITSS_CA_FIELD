Description:
This package includes source code of the MMITSS California implementation. In the MMITSS CA implementation,
the MRP (MMITSS Roadside Processor) is a Linux-based industrial PC, which host the core MMITSS applications,
including Intelligent Signal Control (I-SIG), Signal Priority (SP) and real-time performace observer (PERF-OBS), 
and interface with the Caltrans 2070 contrller. The RSE bridges the over-the-air DSRC messages and the MMITSS 
internal messages. The OBE processes SPaT, MAP and SSM messages and broadcasts BSM and SRM messages for the services 
of MMITSS I-SIG and SP.

The PED-SIG (part of I-SIG) utilizes Savari SmartCross application, from which a pedestrian can send a request for 
ped phase service. Please contact Savari for the SmartCross application. 

The source code are in the following folders (each folder includes a README):
   mrp: source code and configuration files for applications running on MRP. 
   RSE_OBE: source code and configuration files for applications running on Savari STREETWAVE (RSE ver 3.1) 
            or MobiWAVE (OBE ver 3.1). Savari STREETWAVE or MobiWAVE toolchain is required to compile the source code.
            Please contact Savari for STREETWAVE or MobiWAVE SDK.
