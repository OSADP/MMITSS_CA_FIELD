This directory includes C++ source code for library functions of J2735 message encoding/decoding
and locating vehicles (BSMs) on the MAP. The J2735 message encoding and decoding are based on 
SAE J2375_200911 (C source code in the 'asn1' subdirectory)

To build the code in this directory (check makefile in the 'src' subdirectory):  
1) cd src
2) make all          # will create an 'obj' subdirectory to save *.o and libdsrc.a
3) make install      # will create a 'release' subdirectory and copy libdsrc.a over
