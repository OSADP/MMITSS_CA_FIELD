# About

This directory includes .[ch] files generated by the open source ASN.1 compiler '[asn1c](http://lionet.info/asn1c/compiler.html)'.
It includes SAE J2735 message sets defined in version J2735_201603_ASN, and supports ASN.1 Unaligned Packed Encoding Rules (UPER).

# SAE J2735 DSRC Message Set Dictionary

The J2735 PDF of DSRC message set dictionary and the ASN files are available at [SAE](http://www.sae.org/standardsdev/dsrc/).

# ASN.1 Compiler

Users of MMITSS-CA package do not need to install the 'asn1c' package. If interested, 'asn1c' package
is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/vlm/asn1c). Additional information regarding 'asn1c' is available at
[asn1c - Open Source ASN.1 Compiler](http://lionet.info/asn1c/compiler.html).

# Build and Install

This directory is included in the top-level (directory 'mrp') Makefile and does not need to build
manually. After the compilation process, a shared library ('libasn.so') is created in the 'asn/lib'
subdirectory. Users do not directly use the 'libasn.so' for UPER encoding and decoding of SAE J2735
messages, but rather using interface functions provided in the 'asn1j2735' directory.
